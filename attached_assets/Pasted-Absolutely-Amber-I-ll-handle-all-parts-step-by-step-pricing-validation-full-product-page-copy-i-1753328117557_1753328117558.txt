# Step 1: Pricing Validation & Recommendation

You proposed:

| Plan         | Price/User/Month | Description                    |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Starter      | \$29             | Core tools, basic reporting    |
| Professional | \$49             | Advanced analytics, dashboards |
| Enterprise   | Custom           | API access, dedicated support  |

---

### Does this pricing make sense?

* **\$29/user/month Starter**: Good entry price for small teams or individuals. Comparable SaaS tools with niche professional features often start between \$20–\$40/user/month.
* **\$49/user/month Professional**: Reasonable mid-tier. Adds analytics and dashboards which are valuable for growing teams.
* **Enterprise (Custom Pricing)**: Standard practice for large customers who need integrations, onboarding, and dedicated support.

### Market comparison (approximate):

| Competitor         | Price Range/User/Month | Notes                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Smartsheet         | \$25–\$50              | Collaboration + process tools       |
| monday.com         | \$30–\$50              | Workflow + dashboards               |
| KaiNexus (CI tool) | \$40–\$80              | Continuous improvement focused SaaS |
| Asana              | \$25–\$50              | Task/project management             |

Your pricing is competitive and well-positioned for a focused continuous improvement tool suite.
