Great question, Amber. Many Six Sigma tools can be **automated or semi-automated** and integrated into a **web-based application**, especially those involving structured data collection, analysis, or visualization. Here's a breakdown of **which tools are practical for web automation** and how they might work on your website (like the one you're building for Alturos Praxis):

## üîß Technologies You Could Use

Given your tech stack (Flask + Jinja2 + SQLite), you can implement many of these using:

* **Backend**: Python (with NumPy, SciPy, Pandas for math/stats)
* **Frontend**: HTML + Tailwind + JS (Chart.js, D3.js, Mermaid, Drag-and-drop libraries)
* **Database**: SQLite for storing user projects/data
* **Optional**: Export to PDF/CSV, use HTMX or Alpine.js for interactivity

## üß© Suggestions for MVP Tools on Your Website

For your **first rollout**, I suggest starting with:

1. **SIPOC Builder**
2. **CTQ Tree**
3. **5 Whys**
4. **Pareto & Histogram Charts**
5. **FMEA Calculator**
6. **PDCA Tracker**
7. **Control Plan Generator**
8. **KPI Dashboard (linked to CSV upload or manual entry)**

Would you like me to generate one of these as a working HTML/JS template or Flask component to start?
