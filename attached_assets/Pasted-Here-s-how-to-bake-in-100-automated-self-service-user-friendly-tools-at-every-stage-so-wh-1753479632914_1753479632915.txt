Here’s how to bake in **100% automated**, **self‑service**, user‑friendly tools at every stage—so when someone buys a package, they instantly get exactly what they paid for with zero manual hand‑offs.

---

## 1. Automated Onboarding & Tiered Access

1. **Immediate Provisioning via Stripe Webhooks**

   * **Starter Audit** → on `checkout.session.completed`, trigger Zapier/Integromat to:

     * Grant the user a “Starter” role in your user database (Airtable, Firebase, or Auth0).
     * Send a welcome email with a unique, expiring link to the SIPOC Wizard & Pareto tool.
   * **Optimization Package** → same as Starter, plus links to Flow Analyzer & Root‑Cause Explorer.
   * **Transformation Retainer** → add monthly access flags to all eight tools and schedule their first Control Chart report automatically.

2. **Self‑Service Dashboard**

   * Build a simple React dashboard behind authentication.
   * Show a list of “Your Tools” based on their package: clickable cards for each tool (e.g. “Quick Process Snapshot,” “Issue Prioritizer”).
   * Under each card:

     * **“Launch”** button → opens the interactive tool in a modal or full‑screen canvas.
     * **“Download Your Report”** (where applicable) → regenerates the latest PDF on demand.

3. **Automated Scheduling**

   * Embed Calendly links that pre‑fill their email & package tier.
   * After they complete any tool, pop a “Book Your Debrief” widget right in the interface—no extra forms.

## 2. Tool‑Specific Automations

| Tool                         | When & How It Fires Automatically                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SIPOC Wizard**             | Immediately after payment. Sends them a “start here” email with link to fill in Suppliers→Customers map.                                                          |
| **Pareto Issue Prioritizer** | After they submit top issues, it emails a PDF chart and summary bullets.                                                                                          |
| **Flow Analyzer**            | Enabled only for Optimization & Retainer. Users upload/process map; system flags bottlenecks instantly.                                                           |
| **Root‑Cause Explorer**      | As part of the 5 Whys & Fishbone suite—runs back‑to‑back in one flow for Optimization clients.                                                                    |
| **Stability Tracker**        | For Retainer clients: automatically ingests their uploaded CSV each month (or pulls from Google Sheets) and emails a control‑chart report on day 1 of each month. |
| **Risk Matrix Builder**      | Quarterly for Retainer—Zapier’s scheduler fires a link to their dashboard to re‑rate FMEA items.                                                                  |

All tools live as **embedded React components** or **Canvas.js** sketches, so users never leave your site.

## 3. Payment & Access Automation

1. **Stripe + Auth**

   * Use [Stripe Customer Portal](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal) so clients can upgrade/downgrade anytime.
   * On any subscription change, Stripe’s webhook updates their role in your Auth provider, instantly adding/removing tool cards from their dashboard.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Logic**

   * In your dashboard, show “Your Next Renewal” with date and amount.
   * If they upgrade mid‑cycle, show a prorated credit and new access rights.

3. **Automated Reminders & Upsells**

   * Email drip sequences (via ActiveCampaign or HubSpot):

     * **Starter → Optimization**: after 7 days, “Unlock deeper analysis with Flow Analyzer”
     * **Optimization → Retainer**: after 30 days, “Keep your gains on autopilot—monthly monitoring & coaching”

## 4. Putting It All on Replit (MVP Scaffold)

1. **Auth & Dashboard**

   * Use Next.js with **Auth0** (free tier) and **Serverless API routes**.
2. **Tool Endpoints**

   * Create `/api/tools/[toolName]` that reads user’s role, returns config (which tools to render).
3. **Stripe Webhooks**

   * Add `/api/webhooks/stripe` to:

     * Update Auth0 metadata (package tier).
     * Fire further hooks into your automation platform.
4. **Zapier/Integromat**

   * Catches Stripe events → updates Airtable → sends SendGrid emails → optionally pings Slack for you.

All code lives in one Repl. Deploy with a single click, point your custom domain to Replit, and watch payments instantly unlock self‑service tools.

### ✅ The Result

* **User‑friendly**: one dashboard, one login, all their tools clearly listed.
* **Automated**: purchase → provisioning → tool access → reporting → follow‑up—all without you lifting a finger.
* **Scalable**: every new client simply signs up, pays, and is on‑boarded in seconds.
