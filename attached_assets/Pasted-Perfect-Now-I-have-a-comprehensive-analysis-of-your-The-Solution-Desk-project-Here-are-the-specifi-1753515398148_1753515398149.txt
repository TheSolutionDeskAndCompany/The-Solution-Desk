Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive analysis of your The Solution Desk project. Here are the specific findings:

üîç PROJECT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
Your project has 270 files with 84 code files analyzed

üóëÔ∏è ITEMS TO REMOVE (31 items)
High Priority Removals:

Console.log statements: 24 console.log calls across multiple files that should be removed for production
Unused imports: 31 files have unused imports that can be safely removed, including:
Badge, Users in sidebar.tsx
useState in multiple modal components
Download, TrendingUp in tool components
type VariantProps in multiple UI components
Files to Clean:

Remove duplicate SVG files in ./attached_assets/ (they already exist in ./client/public/assets/)
üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX (27 issues)
Production-Breaking Issues:

Debug code: 24 console.log statements in production files
TODO comments: 204 TODO/FIXME comments across files that need resolution
Long lines: 1,595 lines exceed 120 characters affecting readability
Key Files Needing Attention:

server/email-automation.ts: 7 console.log statements
server/index.ts: 7 console.log statements
client/src/pages/tool-dashboard.tsx: 2 console.log statements
.config/.semgrep/semgrep_rules.json: 162 TODO comments, 1,493 long lines
üí° CODE IMPROVEMENTS (26 suggestions)
Code Quality Issues:

Loose equality: 86 instances of == should be === across 20+ files
Large dependency count: 86 runtime + 22 dev dependencies (consider audit)
Files with Most Issues:

client/src/pages/automation.tsx: 12 loose equality issues
client/src/pages/demo.tsx: 12 loose equality issues
server/automation.ts: 11 loose equality issues
üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
Phase 1 - Quick Wins (30 minutes):

Remove all 24 console.log statements from server and client code
Delete duplicate SVG files in ./attached_assets/ folder
Clean up unused imports (automated with IDE)
Phase 2 - Code Quality (1 hour):

Replace all 86 == with === for strict equality
Address high-priority TODO comments in server files
Break down long lines in critical files
Phase 3 - Deep Cleanup (2 hours):

Dependency audit - remove unused packages
Resolve remaining TODO/FIXME comments
Code formatting for line length compliance
Estimated Space/Performance Savings:

Remove ~50KB of unused code and imports
Eliminate production debugging overhead
Improve code maintainability and readability
Would you like me to start implementing these cleanup actions, or do you want to focus on a specific area first?
